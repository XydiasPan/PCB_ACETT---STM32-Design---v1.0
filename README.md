# PCB_ACETT---STM32-Design---v1.0
This repository is only available in its limited form to prevent copying files and IREROBOT's core idea. The main goal of the source code is to accompany the PCB design and further experiment on the audio applications on the board.

# Description
This is a re-design of ACETT *PROTOTYPE* module based on STM32 MCU. Here I added : 1) 4 buttons (1 on/off, 3 for the user interface) 2) 6 LEDs (2 indicate power from USB/recharge, 4 indicate the modes for the user interface) 3) Far field noise IC is configurable from the MCU 4)Microphones are aligned, buttons have enough space between them, the board outline is identical to the LiPo battery's one with some extension to the one side for the screws.
