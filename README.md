## Overview
The ACETT (Advanced Configurable Experimental Testing Tool) *PROTOTYPE* module has undergone a transformative redesign, leveraging the power of the STM32 MCU platform. Key enhancements include:

1. **Enhanced User Interface:** Introducing four buttons - one for power control and three for intuitive user interaction.
   
2. **Intuitive Visual Feedback:** Incorporating six LEDs to provide clear visual indicators, including power status and mode selection.

3. **Configurable Noise Management:** Integration of a far-field noise IC with configurable settings directly controllable from the MCU.

4. **Optimized Layout:** Meticulously aligned microphones, strategically spaced buttons, and a board outline mirroring the LiPo battery's dimensions, with additional extensions for screw fixation.
